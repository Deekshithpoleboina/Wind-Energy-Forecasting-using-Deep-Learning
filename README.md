# Wind Energy Forecasting using Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning approach to forecast wind energy generation based on historical wind data. The main notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using LSTM (or other RNN-based architectures), and evaluation of results.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `research_DL.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.
- `Wind Data.csv`: The dataset containing historical wind measurements used for training and testing the model.

## ðŸ“Š Project Goals

- Understand wind energy patterns from historical data.
- Develop a deep learning model (e.g., LSTM) to predict future wind energy outputs.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE or MAE.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your code)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## ðŸ”§ Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Deekshithpoleboina/Wind-Energy-Forecasting-using-Deep-Learning]
   cd wind-energy-forecasting
